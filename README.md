# Appointment Manager

This Django project is structured into three main apps:

## 1. accounts
Handles authentication, user profiles, and user roles (Admin, Doctor, Patient, Receptionist).

## 2. appointments
Manages appointment booking, rescheduling, cancellation, and stores appointment details.

## 3. notifications
Handles email/SMS reminders for upcoming appointments and maintains notification logs.

Each app contains placeholder models and views for future development, as well as dedicated folders for templates and static files.
